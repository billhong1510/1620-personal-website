    <h1> Assignment paragraph</h1>
        <h2> An introduction about myself</h2>
    <p>  There is not much interesting about me, but I will keep you entertain about my story as much as possible.
I was born in Vietnam, and spent much of my childhood in the country. It was only when I was 15 that I moved along
 with my family here, in Vancouver. Having been in a third world country, I can't expressed how much I appreciate living 
here. Things that I would have <strong> NEVER </strong> had a chance to experience, either from non existent, heavily 
restricted, or it being too expensive. From something simple that everyone take it for granted here like freedom of speech,
 to something like better education, better life quality, and an actual chance to choose path in life (I <strong> definitely</strong>
 would have end up in a state company office, most foregin companies in the country only hires returning international students or 
 officials' children).I now study CIT at BCIT because I think it is a growing industry field and is heavily demanded in the government sector.
 I currently have little to no knowledge about html, python, or any database so I am looking forward to learning lots from this program.<br>
 Here is a picture of me: <br>
