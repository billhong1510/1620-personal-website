    <h1> Courses informations</h1>
    <p> Ah yes who would't want to know more about the courses that I'm taking. The program that I'm taking is called 
        Computer Information Technology. It basically teaches you on various subjects about (<em>surprise!</em>) computing 
        technologies like database, networking administration, web technology (<em><strong>this</em></strong> thing right here), etc. As short as
        the program is (2 years), the course density and the material is nothing to sneeze at, but at least it's fun and 
        the profs are nice!
